Building an E-commerce Product Categorization Model with Deep Learning

In this project, we develop a predictive model to categorize products within an e-commerce dataset. Product categorization is a supervised classification task where the product categories serve as the target classes, and the features are derived from either the product descriptions or images. Our goal is to achieve high precision in classifying product categories using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Methodology and Approach
Product classification is a common problem in the e-commerce industry, and there are several strategies to address it. We will consider the following approaches:

* Image Classification

* Text Classification

The problem can be tackled in two main ways. Firstly, by using images associated with each item that is mapped to a specific category. We can train deep learning models to predict the category of a new product image. However, a challenge arises when sellers do not always provide images for their products.

The second approach involves multiclass text classification. Here, we use the product description as the feature set and the product category as the label to build the classifier. Product descriptions typically contain detailed information about the items, and with sufficient accuracy, the text can be used to predict the category.

We will build this model using both traditional machine learning algorithms (such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) and deep neural networks.

We will implement multiclass text classification using various deep learning algorithms.
